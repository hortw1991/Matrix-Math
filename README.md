## Compilation

Compilation is done seperatly from linking in this file.  Use the following
make commands:
1. make (or make compile) will compile the individual files into their 'x'.o
files
2. make link will link p1.o with Matrix.o to produce the executable p1
3. make run will run p1 which will produce exhibits of each operation

## Compilation & Run

The easiest way to run this program is with the following:

`make && make link && make run`
